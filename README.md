To start off the data extraction for the pdfs using tabula was very inconsistant, resulting in a LOT of extra code, and non-reusable code, to combat the edge cases and different formating. 
For example, for two tables that should be the same, one table would start the data at row 0 and the other at row 1. Another example about those specific tables is the numbers in one were intergers and floats in the other.
